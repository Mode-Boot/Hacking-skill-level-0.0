# tcp_attack.py

I wrote the Dos attack as it is, but it feels like there is still a long way to go.

How to use it is as follows.

/* -url 

Please paste the specified URL. 

-url < target_url >

*/

/* -port 

When performing a port scan, please specify the port of the beginning and the port of the end.

-port <start_port> <end_port>

*/

/* -send

Please specify the capacity of the data to be sent.

-send <send_date>

*/

/* -task

Please specify the number of tasks performed.

-task <task_date>

*/

It's something like that, so don't expect it to be effective! If you have any advice, please let me know!!
Also, I uploaded it, so the operation is a little different, but the method is the same, so... Yeah, do your best.
